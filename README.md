# DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEM

AI-powered driver monitoring systems offer several advantages such as improved safety, reduced risk of accidents, cost-effectiveness, compliance with regulations, and improved driver performance. By detecting drowsiness, distraction, and other unsafe driving behavior, the system can alert drivers in real-time and prevent accidents. These systems can also help reduce costs associated with accidents, comply with industry regulations, and identify areas for drivers to improve their driving skills. Overall, AI-powered driver monitoring systems provide a range of benefits for drivers and companies alike.
